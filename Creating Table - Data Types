CREATE DATABASE temp;    # To create a database;

# All SQL specific keyword is written in Captial Letter;
# You need to tell mySQL, which database you are going to use while creating a table;
USE temp;

# Creating a table-
CREATE TABLE student (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255)       # VARCHAR -> VARCHAR, are better to use as they occupy space equal to the actual data size.
);

# The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: integer, character, money, date and time, binary, and so on.
# In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.

# char -> 0-255 -> Fixed size -> CHAR(203);
# varchar -> 0-255 -> Variable -> VARCHAR(255) -> Flexible size;
# varchar is always better in terms of memory allocation as it only allocates the space that is going to be used;
# BLOB -> Binary Large Object, stores audios, videos; (0-65535)


# To insert any data in table(Adding an entry/tuple)-
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1,'Harshit');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2,'Gopal');
# To fetch the table-
SELECT * FROM student;

# show databases -> To see all the databases in mysql;
# use temp;  Database changed to temp;
# Database changed
# show tables; -> It'll show tables created in temp; i.e, student

# A,B,C-
# ENUM -> Can assign only one preset values among A,B,C;
# SET -> Can assign one or more preset values;

# ENUM(val1, val2, val3, ...)	A string object that can have only one value, chosen from a list of possible values. 
You can list up to 65535 values in an ENUM list. If a value is inserted that is not in the list, a blank value will be inserted. 
The values are sorted in the order you enter them
# SET(val1, val2, val3, ...)	A string object that can have 0 or more values, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 64 values in a SET list

# Note: All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED or ZEROFILL. 
If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for the column. 
If you add the ZEROFILL option, MySQL automatically also adds the UNSIGNED attribute to the column.
